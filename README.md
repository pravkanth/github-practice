# GIT KEYWORDS
I am learning the github here....

## git clone - use to  download the git repo folder from github to local machine
git clone the folder link in github
git clone https://github.com/praveen-kanth1802/masterminds.git

## git status - will show all the folder that updated,created or deleted 

Git add command

If i create an index.html in my local machine means git does not know about the new file that is being created,so we need to add that to git

## git add index.html 
It is used to add the index.html file to github
                    Or
we can simply do

## git add .
This will add all the files and folder that is being created in the local directory to the github
